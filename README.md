# coderkd10's userscripts

## What ?

Some [userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) to make my life a little easier!

## Get Started ?

To run userscripts you'll need an extension. I prefer [Violent Monkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/). It is Free and Open Source.  
Once you have the extension, just go the script's page on Github and click the Raw button. It should open the UI to install the script.
